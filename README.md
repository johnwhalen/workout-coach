- **Responsive UI**: Built with Mantine UI and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Clerk**: Authentication service for handling user sessions.
- **Fuse.js**: Fuzzy search functionality to enhance search experience for routines and workouts.
- **Mantine UI**: UI library for modern React components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Database Schema

Here is the database schema for tracking user routines, workouts, and sets:

- **User**: Contains `user_id`, `username`, and `password`.
- **Routine**: Contains `routine_id`, `routine_name`, and `user_id`. A routine has multiple workouts.
- **Workout**: Contains `workout_id`, `workout_name`, `routine_id`, and `date`. A workout has multiple sets.
- **Set**: Contains `set_id`, `set_weight`, `set_reps`, `workout_id`, and `date`.
